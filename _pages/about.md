<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now conducting ra work in <img src="images/UST.png" alt="HKUST(gz) Logo" style="height:1.25em; vertical-align:middle;">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), following <a href='https://www.yingcong.me/'>Chen Yingcong（陈颖聪）</a>

As a primary learner in the field of AI, I am now engaged in the research direction of video generation, and intend to make further research in the direction of controllable video generation.

I studied in the School of Computer Science and Technology of Harbin Institute of Technology<img src="images/HIT-大蓝.png" alt="HIT-Logo" style="height:1.5em; vertical-align:middle;"> as an undergraduate. I will get my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and technology in July this year(I hope so, this is a damn story). My undergraduate advisor was <a href='https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/liushaohui'>Liu Shaohui（刘绍辉）.</a>

After that, I will be enrolled as a mphil student in hkust in the fall of 2025. under the guidance of <a href='https://www.yingcong.me/'>Chen Yingcong（陈颖聪）</a>, I will continue to study in the field of generation, and I hope to obtain deeper atabilities.

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
